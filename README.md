You don't need this if you're not using macros since you can just use the default profile and square button.

Use this only if you want to use both macro (profile 1-3) and multi mapping.

I DO NOT recommend to map too many buttons or something risky like that.

1. Configure everything including macro on 8BitDo Ultimate Software V2

2. Map extra buttons with this tool

3. Load the modified profile on 8BitDo Ultimate Software V2

I've posted how to do it with HxD on Korean community before, but I made this tool because there were some people who are not familiar with binary, hex, and bit operation.

Rocket League has been unplayable on PC in South Korea for over 5 years, following the Epic Games service transition on September 25, 2020.

This is despite the PlayStation version remaining fully rated and available in the region. Furthermore, Epic Games was certified as a self-rating operator in Korea on December 28, 2020, granting them the full authority to rate the game and restore service.

They have failed to act, leaving the game unrated and unavailable to the entire KR PC community.
